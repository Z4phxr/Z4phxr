# Hi, I'm Kinga

A third-year Computer Science student specializing in administrative systems management, with a growing passion for Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. Although my academic background is rooted in systems administration, I’ve naturally gravitated toward the AI field, especially areas such as Machine Learning, Computer Vision, and algorithmic problem-solving. I enjoy exploring how code can model complex systems and turn abstract ideas into real, working solutions.
